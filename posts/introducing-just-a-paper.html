        <p>The app name is Just a Paper. As the name suggests, It's just like paper.</p>
        <p>It has only four features: change font style, change font size, adjust width, and change line height. Here's how to install it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install from <a href="https://github.com/manabubannai/just-a-paper/releases/download/v0.0.1/Just.a.Paper-1.0.0-arm64.dmg">Github page</a> (macOS only)</li>
            <li>Run the command below before opening the app</li>
            <li>$ sudo xattr -cr "/Applications/Just a Paper.app"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need to run the command because it's a test app. Without the command, you'll get a warning. The app is open source. You can download and customize it.</p>
